# wordguess
Rebuilt with webpack


## Features
All the features of the original just rebuilt with webpack.

- Players are given a random set of word blanks which they much fill with the correct guesses
- If a player guesses a letter in the random word correctly, that blank is filled with the correct guess
- If a player guesses incorrectly they lose a chance to guess (Max 10 per game)
- Player wins if they fill in all the blanks
